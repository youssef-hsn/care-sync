# Database Schemas

This document explains the database schemas used in the Care-Sync project.

## SQL Schema

**Our schema is defined using drizzle/pg-core typescript representation to give type saftey to quesries inside of each usecase**

## Schema Versioning

**The schema edits can be traced back using git since the schema is defined inside the server/src/db/tables directory**

## Notes
- Document any schema changes here
- The initial setup is to be changed as the application develops
- Thanks for neon, we have seprate branches of our db for development and production
- There is a Github issue open for comments when a schema gets edited so they are reflected on the final ER diagram.
