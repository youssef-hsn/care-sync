# Documentation Guidlines
**This is to make documentation easier to navigate and systemize the documentation process**

# Software Documents

> All the software documentation and diagrams are externaly kept on google docs


# Documentation Structure

To ensure a hierarchical system that can integrate seamlessly with Docusaurus in the future, organize the markdown files as follows:

1. **Documentation Grouping**: related documentation should be categorized in folders as much as possible.
    > It may seem hard to categorize a file without any similar files so you can stick it in a general category though make sure to categorize when possible.
2. **File Naming**: Use lowercase, hyphen-separated filenames (e.g., `introduction.md`, `api-overview.md`).
3. **Consistent Writing**: When writing your documentation, make it consistent to existing docs.

> This is to ensure scalability and compatibility with the Docusaurus system in the possible future.

# Naming Rules
**This is to keep the code consistent accross the backend and the frontend.**

1. **File Names**: Use `kebab-case` for all file names (e.g., `user-guide.md`, `api-reference.md`).

2. **Variable/Function Names**: Use `camelCase` for all variable and function names (e.g., `getUserData`, `fetchDetails`).

3. **Component Names**: Use `TitleCase` for all component names (e.g., `UserCard`, `NavBar`).

> More specific rules can be found accross other documentation.
